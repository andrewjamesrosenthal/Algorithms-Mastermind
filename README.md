Mastermind – EECE 2560 Project
Overview
# 🎯 Mastermind – EECE 2560 Project

## 📖 Overview
This project implements the game **Mastermind**, where the user plays as the *codebreaker* and the computer acts as the *codemaker*.  

- The codemaker generates a random sequence of digits.  
- The codebreaker attempts to guess it within ten tries.  
- After each guess, the codemaker provides feedback:  
  - ✅ **Correct digits in the correct position**  
  - 🔄 **Correct digits in the wrong position**  

The program is written in **C++** and uses modular, object-oriented design.

---

## 🛠 Features
- `Code` class to store and manipulate secret codes and guesses  
- Random code generation based on user-specified length (*n*) and digit range (*m*)  
- Functions to check guesses for correct and misplaced digits  
- A `main()` driver that demonstrates functionality with sample guesses  

---

## 🧩 Part A
- Implements the `Code` class  
- Provides functions:  
  - `checkCorrect()` → digits correct in the right spot  
  - `checkIncorrect()` → digits correct but in the wrong spot  
- Includes a `main()` function that initializes a secret code and tests three sample guesses:

| Guess        | Correct | Incorrect |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 5 0 3 2 6    | ?       | ?         |
| 2 1 2 2 2    | ?       | ?         |
| 1 3 3 4 5    | ?       | ?         |
